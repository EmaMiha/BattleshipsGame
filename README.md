# BATTLESHIPS GAME

Battleships game is a Python game where player tries to beat the computer by finding all of the computer's battleships before the computer finds theirs.

Live version of my project looks like:

## How to play

To play the game, player simply runs the script. The game will prompt player for row and column guesses, provide feedback on his/her guesses, and continue until the player either sink the battleship or run out of turns. Guesses are marked on the board with the "X" and "O" represents the sea. 

### Features

• Ships are randomly places on the board.
• Player can not enter the same guess twice and can not enter the cordinates outside of the board.

### Testing 

• I've manually tested the project in my local terminal and the Code Institute Heroku terminal.
• I've tried to test it on PEP8online.com but it didn't work out, so I made it on pythonchecker.com and no erors were returned.
