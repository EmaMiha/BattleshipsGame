#BATTLESHIPS GAME

Battleships game is a Python game where player tries to beat the computer by finding all of the computer's battleships before the computer finds theirs.

##How to play

To play the game, player simply runs the script. The game will prompt player for row and column guesses, provide feedback on his/her guesses, and continue until the player either sink the battleship or run out of turns. Guesses are marked on the board with the "X" and "O" represents the sea.
